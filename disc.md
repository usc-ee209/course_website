Discussion will be used to introduce lab and review important concepts from lecture.  Be sure to attend.

###Discussion 1 - Modelsim & Tool Setup / Verilog Review
- ModelSim Installation -- See [EE 457 DEN site](https://courses.uscden.net/d2l/home)
    - Follow the instructions on the EE 457 DEN site under the *Lab Setup* module. You will need the username/password credentials on that site to download Modelsim.
    - If you do not have access to a PC, you should consider one of the options below:
        1. Use a Virtual machine image installed on the campus PC userrooms (SAL, WPH, etc.)
            - Login
            - Open the Virtual Machines folder in Programs menu and clicking on the shortcut in the Programs menu labeled XP32-201108-PUVVADA.
            - A window opens with a Windows-XP Desktop. You can invoke Modelsim from there. 
        1. Use the Unix installation.  Follow [these instructions](http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/457/ee457_Verilog/ee457_unix_modelsim_setup_and_testing.pdf)
