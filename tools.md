### Xilinx Setup

#### Using Xilinx on the Viterbi Virtual Desktop (VDI) System
As an engineering student enrolled in this EE course, we will give you access to the Viterbi Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) system which allows you to open a remote desktop/virtual machine with all the engineering software preloaded.  You will need to follow [these directions](http://viterbi.usc.edu/assets/195/94372.pdf) to first install the VDI client and connect.  Once connected you can find Xilinx `ISE Design Suite 14.7` icon on the desktop or search for it in the programs menu.  Remember your files only persist in your `Documents` folder and are lost after each semester.
 
#### Install Modelsim Webpack on your Windows PC 
Follow [these directions](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee209/Xilinx14_7Install_2015.pdf)

  - For those running Windows 8 or 10 you might try this [link](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/microcontrollers/guide-getting-xilinx-ise-to-work-with-windows-8-64-bit/) for tips on getting the installation to work on your OS.

#### Run Xilinx on the Viterbi IT Virtual Desktop Interface.
You can use an Mac or Windows client PC and VMWare's Horizon Client software to connect to a virtual (remote) desktop system where you can run the Xilinx software.  Follow the directions linked below.

  - [Directions for installing VMWare's Horizon Client and connecting to the remote desktop servers](http://viterbi.usc.edu/assets/195/94372.pdf)
  - Notes:
    + Sometimes you have to connect twice (or enter your login info twice).
    + You should save your work in the `U:` drive which will persist from session to session for the length of the semester.  **Any work saved in any other area will usually be deleted nightly**.
    + Let us know if you encounter errors by posting on Piazza.    
    
#### Video Tutorials
Please watch the following 4 videos to learn the basics of using the Xilinx tools:
